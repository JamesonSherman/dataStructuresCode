Okay Murali or Grader whoever is looking at this readme and code. 
SO a couple things to note:
1. the birds.ppm comment line is bad and I commented it out.
I could have sanitized it but you said in class to just remove it. WELL removing it turns the entire file
into sphagetti. With that being said I can look into a fpeek function for sanitizing it or a .ignore line.

3. attached smallA.ppm is a p3 magic number and smallb.ppm is a p6 magic number. At this juncture
it should run both.
