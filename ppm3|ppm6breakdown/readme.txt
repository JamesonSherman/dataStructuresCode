Okay Murali or Grader whoever is looking at this readme and code. 
SO a couple things to note:
1. the birds.ppm comment line is literal garbage and I commented it out.
I could have sanitized it but you said in class to just remove it. WELL removing it turns the entire file
into sphagetti. With that being said look into a fpeek function for sanitizing it or a .ignore line.

2. this homework hurt me domestically.

3. attached smallA.ppm is a p3 magic number and smallb.ppm is a p6 magic number. At this juncture
it should run both or hell at the rate of other kids not being able to do the whole thing i atleast made
a (hopeful) B.
